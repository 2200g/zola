the first time i ever customised my linux set up was back during corona when we still had online classes.

i had watched this video titled: ["cerulean - make linux beautiful"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uucr0xHoz1A) posted by [#sudo](https://www.youtube.com/@sudo_rice). 

i had never really seen such artistic beauty before- i never really had seen any rices up until that point. 

i followed his guide on how to get my setup to look like that, and did everything accordingly. this was during classes - and i couldnt attend any that day haha.


anyways its been like what 2 years since then, and i dont think ive ever went back to a "desktop environment" or uh a non-tiling window manager since then. (i do not know the proper terminology :3)

i've used multiple window managers - bspwm, i3wm, xmonad, awesomewm, qtile and now dwm. i've riced p much all of em following tutorials and stuff and yeah its been pretty fun. i dont really get why i like to switch wms sm but yea. 

currently, i am an avid fan of [bugswriter](https://youtube.com/@bugswriter_), and i watch pretty much every video he uploads. he uploaded this video, titled: ["linux ricing crash course."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqVuAUP2N0) and it went over pretty much every point you need to have a nicely riced set-up.

ill link a couple of stuff to supplement the things he went over in his video: 

- [sxhkd.](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sxhkd) you can use this as your hotkey manager, instead of writing it in dwm's config and recompiling the program everytime. here is [my config for sxhkd](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1043271659882291311/1119681513873756200/sxhkdrc).
- [newlook.](https://github.com/2200g/newlook) this is basically his newlook.sh - you might want to change the xrdb thingy.
- [wallpapers.](https://aadi.net.in/walls/) you can download my wallpaper collection here <3

and uh yes ok bye for now.
