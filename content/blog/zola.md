zola is this really nice ssg i found, similar to hugo, but written in rust.
<!-- more -->

## zola.

i am going to port over all other posts and yeah im going to have my own website, without using a prebuilt theme.


tbh even tho its wayyy easier to just use a pre-built theme provided by others, there is no fun doing so. you dont really get to do stuff on ur own and yeah i want to learn new things.

you can read more about zola [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/#zola-at-a-glance).

i am having fun w it, and its simple like every other ssg.

anyways yeah you can also find my old site at uh https://old.aadi.net.in or [here](https://old.aadi.net.in).
