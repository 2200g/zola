ive been rather bored as of late but o welp

also my half-yearlys are going on aha and yeah thats pretty much it.

ive also made it so that my obsidian thing magicky gets backed up on git and thats pretty cool i guess and i can also use the git repo to make it accessible via obsidian mobile i guess lets see.

oh speaking about phones, i have pretty much cut off social media and stuff so thats good and all yesyes

im also using a habit tracker to take care of myself!1! idk yes okok bye :)
