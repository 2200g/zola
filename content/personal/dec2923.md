hi all

idk why i havent updated in so so long but i guess its only fair if i do so now

a lot has changed -- i shifted the site from github pages to my own rpi0w. now if the site is down i suppose its due to fault on my end but o welp 
im not sure why i did that but yeah was a fun experience

i made a file server for myself using [filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) its really neat and minimal and cool and works somewhat perfectly(?) on the rpi.


i had family visiting and was somewhat occupied and all i guess.

oh yeah i have also started using this cool ncurses program for spotify called [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot/)

i really love it -- i did try [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui), another popular name in the spotify cli userspace but uh it was really slow for me and i couldnt figure out why so i gave up on it :/


studies havent been going well unfortunately im afraid, im like totally not meeting the expectations i have of myself but uh yeah im trying to become better 



anyways a very merry christmas to everyone (even though im like 3 days late) and i hope you all have a goood year the upcoming year.
thansks a lot for reading all this and cyall bye :)

( PS follow my spotify @ [/spotify](https://aadi.net.in/spotify) c: )
