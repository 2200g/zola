june went by pretty fast and so has this third of july but yes anyways.

not that anyone cares but i did not post a whole lot of stuff in june - i was busy most of the time.

i had my summer vacation for like three weeks and yea i studied pretty much the entire time aha - its fun for me tho.

i made a couple of new friends irl and found out one of ems actually nice and ye

ive also been playing throwball a lot and not to toot my own horn but i am actually pretty insane at throwball :)))

im planning to write a blog post on something a teacher once told me about personalities and originality which ended up being pretty deep once i realised the significance of her words.
