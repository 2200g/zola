okay so to concentrate on important things, you sometimes have to let go of other things, that may not seem as significant as the important thing.

its really important to manage your time properly and accordingly give specific amounts of time for one task.

quitting a game like minecraft is really hard, as you sometimes develop somewhat of a connection w the people you play with or even the game itself. even though it sometimes gets repetitive, it really is fun to play. 

i have quit minecraft for a bit a couple of times and everytime i return to it, the feeling is exhilarating. i have fun doing the same old thing again and remembering certain events and that makes it all the more enjoyable to me.

but, doing the same thing over and over again gets really boring and you just play for the sake of it, not just cuz ure having fun. you just spend hours and hours grinding for stats that dont even matter much. 

im not saying that the game sucks, or is dead, but that to truly enjoy yourself you have to sometimes take a step back, and just stop playing. instead, focus on other things, till you start craving for the game once again. only then it is possible to truly enjoy the beauty of a game like minecraft.

ok bai.
